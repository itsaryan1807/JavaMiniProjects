# Java Development 🧑‍💻

Welcome to my **Java Development** repository!  
This project includes all the hands-on work I've done to strengthen my Java skills — from basic programs to intermediate-level applications. Each file here reflects a concept, challenge, or mini project I’ve built while practicing core Java.

## 🔰 Description

This repository is divided into two main sections:

### 🟢 Basic Folder
Contains simple Java practice projects to revise syntax, conditionals, loops, methods, and basic logic building. These are beginner-friendly and helped me get comfortable with Java programming.

### 🔵 Intermediate Folder
Includes projects with slightly more complexity and real-world relevance. Some files like `E_Commerce_App.java` simulate real applications and involve more advanced concepts like classes, arrays, logic-based operations, and object-oriented programming.
